## UW Reopening
For the UW Reopening project, we run the uw-ehs-report job to gather COVID-19 test results and send information to the UW EH&S team's REDCap project (EH&S Data Transfer for Husky Coronavirus Testing). Alerts are configured on this REDCap project that send an email to an internal email address that then forwards the notification to the "ncov-reporting" Slack channel.
